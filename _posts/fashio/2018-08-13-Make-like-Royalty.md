<p>I believe that an LBD is one of the most important staples in a stylish woman’s wardrobe But sometimes your perfect Little Black Dress just happens to be a perfect Little Plum Dress by <a href="https://www.mishacollection.eu/shop.html?utm_source=instagrambio&utm_medium=instagram&utm_campaign=shopall" target="_blank">Misha Collection</a> 
<p>All shades of purple have connotations of Royalty and that is no bad thing when your mission is to create a wow factor.</p>

<p>This fabulous, plum coloured dress is dramatic in its tailored elegance and the oversized button detail means no accessories needed. Winter or summer, this dress is perfect for parties, cocktails or dinner. Its beautiful neckline and figure hugging silhouette are offset by a classic cream coat (for chillier climates) and a demure cream handbag - very much in the style of the late Diana, Princess of Wales. Sexy but elegant power dressing at its best. Cream, rather than white, is the better contrast with a rich purple spectrum colour such as plum: it enables your colour palette to exude harmony from tip to toe.</p>
<p>Finish your look with oversized sunglasses  and deep matching plum lipstick for that killer, glamour edge.</p>
