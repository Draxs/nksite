<p>Dancing makes me happy. Dancing keeps me fit and healthy, makes me smile and this outfit makes me think about dancing: an accordion pleated skirt in light chiffon with dramatic colour blocking is the floaty, twirly girly focus of my outfit. You could keep the skirt simple with a black sleeveless top for a more serious take or get ready to go dancing with a polka dot, boat necked top in diaphanous chiffon. This top is just sheer enough to just see my Calvin Klein bra. Underwear this good should not be hidden.</p>
<p>A delicate pink, longline blazer with structured tailoring provides an unusual counterpoint. This makes my outfit work ready or date ready with just a swing on or off of a jacket.</p>

<p>Because there is a lot happening with my look, I have swept my hair up into a sleek and glossy topknot, so that the focus is on the fabrics and colours I am wearing. Heels are a must. Keep your bag small and a ‘handbag’, as opposed to a messenger style or tote design. Keep the focus on you. My trademark sunnies are octagonal frames with pink lenses to finish this fabulous look.</p>
<p>I haven’t stopped dancing yet.</p>
