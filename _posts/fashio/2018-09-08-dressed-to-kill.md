There are some designers who can just create the ‘Wow’ factor every time and Australian brand <a href="http://www.jadore.com.au/" target="_blank">Jadore</a> are guaranteed to pull out the red carpet look with every collection.

As you know, my preferred style is classic with a twist and this LBD just hits every note: knee skimming, with exquisite lace detailing, a short sleeve and bateau neckline completed by an extravagant organza chiffon ‘over- dress ‘to create drama and flair, this little number works for every event from a ball to a wedding to a launch party, especially if you feel like having a little of the limelight!

I love the way this dress fits to give you a beautiful outline but has such elegant movement in the fabric that you really want to dance. Whatever your shape, this LBD is a winner all round.

The lacework is exquisite and lifts this dress into a whole new level of glamour and style. You really need to do little more than elegant hair and great shoes to look amazing. I kept my makeup minimal but perfectly applied, nude nails and no jewellery.

When you need a stand-out dress that makes you feel effortlessly special, then this brand needs to be your go-to site. Don’t forget your sunnies for the finishing touch.
