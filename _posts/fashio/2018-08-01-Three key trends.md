<p>With a polka dot, sheer blouse and yellow paper bag trousers. The spot design is bang on trend whilst preserving your modesty and the boat neckline, as favoured by new Royal Meghan Markle, suits all.</p>
<p>Muted yellow is a perfect colour for those seasonal changes – whether spring to summer or summer to autumn - and paper bag trousers are made for showing off a nipped in waist.</p>

<p>The ultimate Insta moment is given with the perfectly casual shoulder drape of the grey coat.</p>
<p>Add round sunnies - as seen at Prada and Valentino -  and an oversized clutch and you are good to go – anywhere!</p>
