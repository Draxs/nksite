Have you ever noticed how well Mediterranean women do pastels in autumn and winter? Maybe it’s the light here, but the weight and weave of the fabric also make a difference. Delicate silks and cottons are perfect for summer, however, as the seasons change, it’s nice to have  more of a layer between you and the wind.

So why wear brown or grey? If you want to hold on to that final summer feeling, choose pastels.

I plumped for Baby Pink, Dove Grey and Bright White for this outfit; these are not neutral colours by any means so you need to aware of how your shades  and hues work. And you need to consider your fabrics.

My lined jacket allows me to be brave and wear the skimpiest of skimpy as a base layer so the jacket is a major statement. Pushing back the sleeves to bracelet length doesn’t just show off the pretty lining, but also gives you an opportunity to display a little jewellery or just tanned arms to suit your style. As the jacket is tailored, it also highlights your figure and gives real glamour.

Last, but certainly not least – accessories. My beautiful <a href="https://www.cameliaroma.com/en/" target="_blank">Camelia Roma</a> bag is the perfect shade, not to mention the perfect size. The detachable strap means it works brilliantly as a clutch or a cross body depending on where you are going.

Finish off this serious styled look with sleek hair and a full on plum pout; the delicacy of the pastels works fabulously with dramatic but sophisticated makeup. And, of course, never be without the perfect sunnies.

Hello autumn but it’s not quite farewell summer yet.
