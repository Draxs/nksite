<p>There comes a time, in even the most dedicated fashionista’s life, when the word ‘comfort’ is the goal. However, comfort does not mean effort free but effortless: it means well-fitting clothes in beautiful fabrics, so that you look effortlessly relaxed. My way, you can easily do this, even in heels.</p>
<p>When summer hits and the temperature is rising, looking relaxed is ever more important. Casual chic is easily attained with these lightweight culotte style pants with their beautiful detailing and subtle colours. I love it when you find a staple that you can mix and match with everything in your wardrobe. If you travel, these pants are perfect as they can be dressed up or down to suit each occasion and take up no room in your bag. Pack a tee and espadrilles to wear with these pants and you are beach ready. Wear heels and a glamorous black top, grab your tote and you are perfectly attired for a long day, office to event, without a hair out of place.</p>

<p>The stripes and styling of these particular trousers are very flattering. They lengthen your leg to create a rangy silhouette, while still showing off your tan and calves. Complete the look with shoes the same colour as your top to create symmetry.</p>
<p>Comfort and style never looked so good.</p>
