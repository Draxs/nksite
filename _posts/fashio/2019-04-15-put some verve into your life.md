I am the first to admit to having a bit of an internet shopping habit but there is still very little that beats the thrill of shopping for real. The opportunity to touch the fabrics and see how the clothes fit is a big deal for me so imagine my delight when I found <a href="https://www.verveboutique.com/" target="_blank">Verve</a> in Naxxar.

<a href="https://www.verveboutique.com/" target="_blank">Verve</a> offers a highly personalised service and source their lines from Milan, Paris and Madrid as well as L.A. You also know that, unlike the chain stores, the clothes are that little bit more unique so there won’t be six of you in the same dress!

Classic with a twist is my style and this elegant, shocking pink skirt does the perfect job. Pleats are hot now so expect to see every pattern and shade on the streets this summer. Choosing a strong colour works well for all sizes and allows you more ‘verve’ (sorry but it had to be done!) with your choice of top. My 100% pure silk wrap shirt is a keeper. Jewel colours andunusual prints with a dramatic neckline means this shirt works day to night and with every colour and shade.

The deep neckline is the perfect design to showcase long necklaces. I love the three lengths of pendant and chain combo and this gives another layer of discreet glamour to any outfit. Add oversized sunnies with a delicate frame and glossy hair and lips to complete your show stealer look. Thank you <a href="https://www.verveboutique.com/" target="_blank">Verve</a>, you made a good experience a great one.
