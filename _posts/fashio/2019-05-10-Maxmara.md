Usually I am sad to say goodbye to summer but not this year. Roll on autumn with <a href="https://mt.weekendmaxmara.com/new-arrival?gclsrc=aw.ds&&gclid=EAIaIQobChMI0__qpJPp5AIVEM53Ch0ECAMbEAAYASAAEgIg2fD_BwE" target="_blank">WEEKEND MAXMARA</a> and their gorgeous collection. This brand is world renowned for THE ultimate styling in camel coats and AW19 is no exception. Investment shopping never looked or felt so good. ‘Buttermilk’ is big this season but camel is for keeps. Make sure you invest in quality and you can never go wrong.

My ‘Corona’ wool, alpaca and mohair mix coat, lined in satin twill, is a winner as a statement piece. Lightweight, clean draping means this coat is the most versatile and elegant itemyou can put in your wardrobe; not just this year but for many years to come.

Worn loose, or belted to show off a neat waist, this coat works over jeans, work suits, evening dress or athleisure. Regardless of whether you are colour blocking co-ords or playing with patterns, there is nothing a camel coat does not go well with. Moreover blonde, auburn or brunette, we all look gorgeous in camel.

I paired mine with a <a href="https://mt.weekendmaxmara.com/new-arrival?gclsrc=aw.ds&&gclid=EAIaIQobChMI0__qpJPp5AIVEM53Ch0ECAMbEAAYASAAEgIg2fD_BwE" target="_blank">WEEKEND MAXMARA</a> ‘Cabina’ silk twill shirt and white, tailored ‘Alibi’ cigarette pants in a stretch gaberdine cotton. Perfect detailing in the shirt is showcased in the buttoned cuff and long sleeves as well as the vibrant multicolour design. This is how you bring the last of summer back to your wardrobe.
