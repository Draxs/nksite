<p>Some women don’t like pink as they worry they won’t be taken seriously. Seriously?</p>
<p>Trust me, the trick is in the hues and shades you choose: my red, wrap style shirt is perfect with or without a tan and is fabulously versatile. Blouses and shirts are key statements of an outfit and this ticks every box, with its OTT full sleeves, tie wrap detail, deep neckline and strong, pure colour.</p>
<p><img src="{{ '/images/fashion/Blush&Red.jpg' | prepend: SourceUrl }}" alt="Blush&Red.jpg"></p>
<p>Teamed with my favourite style trousers in blush pink, this makes the rich, watermelon red of the shirt effortlessly flow into the subtle pink shade of the trousers to create a look that is both pretty and striking simultaneously.</p>
<p>I love the elegant, unfussiness of these classic, tailored trousers. Great for streamlining and lengthening your figure.</p>
<p>Team with a strong lip colour and over sized sunnies to complete your ’film star on the Riviera’ look and keep accessories to a minimum. Believe me, real women wear pink.</p>
