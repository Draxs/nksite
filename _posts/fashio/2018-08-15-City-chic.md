How to make colder weather stylish? 

Those of you who know me, know that I don’t do cold. However, that doesn’t mean that I don’t know how to do cold! Bright sunny days, as the weather changes and cools, provide a perfect opportunity for some elegant snuggling with wool and cashmere. White white jeans, with a deep turn up, make the most of the light and give a great counterpoint to my monochrome, belted coat with its jet black lining.

Patch pockets are the best for keeping your hands warm while strolling casually through the city and the neat belt cinches your waist to keep you looking sleek. I could have chosen a black sweater to keep the monochrome look but my delicate salmon polo provides a great pop of colour without taking away from the black and white styling. The finishing touch for this outfit has to be these beautiful shoes:

flash a tanned ankle with these bejwelled slingback heels. The ‘diamonds’ give a gorgeous sparkle and will take you straight to The Ritz if you fancy. Keep your make up flawless,with a strong lip colour and perfect brows.
