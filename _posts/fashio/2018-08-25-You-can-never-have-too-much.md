<p>Sometimes life is good. You find the perfect shirt that makes you look and feel a million dollars (without costing that of course) </p>
<p>Sky blue silk, with kimono style sleeves for utter decadence, this wrap shirt is a total statement. The Japanese feel is carried through the beautiful flower detailing and elegant V neck. I paired this top with a vintage, pearlescent white pencil skirt and tied the shirt at the back to keep the lines pure and streamlined. However, this top works with everything: skinny jeans, palazzo pants, a fitted evening skirt or my favourite high waisted trousers - all will and do look amazing.</p>

<p>I kept my hair hanging straight and glossy to reinforce the lean silhouette that makes you look elegantly elongated and effortlessly elegant. Catsâ€™ eye sunnies are the perfect finishing touch; keep your heels at killer height as this is a killer look.</p>
<p>Too much of a good thing? Never.</p>
