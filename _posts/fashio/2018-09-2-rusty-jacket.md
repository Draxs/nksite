When I was at art school, a paint colour I always liked was Burnt Umber.  A rich, warm, reddey-orangey-brown, it is the colour of autumn. But it is also the preferred colour of the Baroque artists: Caravaggio and Rembrandt used it and so, when in Valletta, Baroque capital city, this is the shade a stylish woman should wear. But, trust me, this colour will travel.

My amazing bomber style jacket by <a href="https://www.quizclothing.co.uk/" target="_blank">QUIZ</a> is perfect for when the weather starts to change and there is that gorgeous freshness in the air. A ‘Rust Must’, the faux suede effect and furry lining is beautifully soft and cosy. The large collar for snuggling and neat zipper details make it effortlessly chic. The slash side pockets - also with zips - are great for keeping your bits and pieces safe on those days when you don’t want a bag, as well as keeping your hands toastie warm.

An on point tweed wrap skirt and perfect cream cable knit keep this look elegantly casual for the sunny autumn days, but a black crewneck and skinnies would look super cool with this jacket too. I plumped for a sleek but natural make up look, as the dramatic colour of the jacket is the focal point. You could work a high shine lip gloss for evenings, but I chose a very natural, matte lip colour in the pinkish brown spectrum and elegant sweeping brows to keep my styling sleek. Never forget the perfect sunglasses to give you effortlessly sexy glamour.

I love this jacket: warm without being heavy, great with jeans or over dresses for a more work ready look and in an amazing shade that suits every colouring and skin tone. Expect a lot of compliments.
