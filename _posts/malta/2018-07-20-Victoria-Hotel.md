The <a href="https://victoriahotel.com/" target="_blank">Victoria Hotel</a> in Sliema is wonderful. That’s official. Having spent a weekend there, I am completely relaxed and ready for anything.
The overall feel is like a beautiful Victorian club – references to the novelist Dickens and lots of leather and fireplaces. Sadly, no dogs but the chair cushions more than made up for that.

I chose a Grecian style dress AFTER dinner, but comfort and elegance should be intertwined. It’s easier to look stylish when you are well groomed. Sleek hair and subtle make-up always make you ready for any- and everything.

All the rooms are beautiful. The suites have recently been refurbished and the 7th floor offer the AX Designer Suites. They are stunning with their dramatic colour schemes and every luxury you could imagine. Comfort, elegance and style all in one space! Situated on the 7th floor with beautiful views, the highlight was our own private sauna outside on the terrace. I think this is pretty unique in Malta and it was only the lovely food that tempted me out of it!

However, my posts are not always about food - although the Victoria serves a fantastic breakfast. Diet jam – now that’s good news.

This hotel is an unmissable opportunity to dress up. Winter pastels, statement shoes and a great blow dry are all good ways to look stylish and sophisticated.

Copperfield’s Restaurant is more of a Victorian ‘ladies who lunch’ place – beautiful patterned wallpaper, wonderful chandeliers and deep carpets make it perfect for glamorous lunches or dinners - it’s luxury all the way. The menu is varied and delicious and the room looked spectacular set for a big event when we were there. A magical space for a winter wedding or big dinner party.

The Penny Black Bar is like the greatest London pub you ever visited with its polished wooden tables and chairs and big leather sofas. This is a great place for a winter’s drink or to meet with friends and it’s my new find for showing my guests the other side of life in Malta but inside.
