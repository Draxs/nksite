<a href="https://thepalacemalta.com/" target="_blank">The Palace</a> is one of my favourite hotels in Malta. Situated in Sliema, with a spa, roof top infinity pool, great staff, fabulous views across to Valletta and St Julian’s and, possibly, the best Oriental food in Malta at TemptAsian – well, what’s not to like? Recently they refurbished some of their suites and the design style is classic with a twist. Six designer suites ,all distinctive in their own way, View, Texture, Music, Light, Flavours and Fragrance are their thoughtful and evocative names. Reminiscent of a different time, a more graceful and unhurried style of life, they are specifically designed to provide maximum enjoyment and boost the overall experience for each guest.

Whenever you have any doubt, always go with the fabrics: a plum, washed silk jumpsuit will take you wherever you wish to go – and back again. Whether you are lounging in comfort or ready for dinner, this beautiful colour will suit anyone and everyone, while the silk whispers luxury and decadence.

I stayed in the Fragrance Suite. This was picture perfect; from the white wrought iron bed (also super comfortable), silver backed hairbrushes and beautiful fragrance bottles with their elegant stoppers, nothing had been forgotten to make you feel that you had just stepped into a different world.

A balcony for breakfast, a sumptuous sofa for reclining, a 5* bathroom and all the touchpoints that touch your senses. I really did not want to go home. Floaty material works perfectly in the heat to keep you looking cool and glamorous throughout the day. Metallic or beaded sandals, a great bag and your sunnies are all a girl needs to breakfast at The Palace.

Much as I love Asian food, I dined at ‘A Tavola’ on Saturday night and what a winner. Situated between The Palace and Palazzo Capua in Alexandra Gardens, the fabulous inside/outside ambiance is the perfect destination for Date Night, Girls’ Night or just for you to have the most delicious pizza and glass of good wine. Really good wine. I love buzzy restaurants with great staff and happy diners and so ‘A Tavola’ delivers on all fronts. Maybe I just found my new home.

 So, what to pack in your luggage if you want to spend the weekend living in elegant luxury and class but while dining out on classic pizza or pasta in a truly, out-of-this- world ambiance? Whether a sophisticated pose in coral or a sneaky way of eating pizza without having to loosen your belt, my striking, strapless dress will take you beach to bar to dinner. The flowing silk, that drapes from the bustline and with a discreet thigh slit, is designed to move effortlessly with you. The beautiful soft colour is rich enough to work day to night. Choose your shoes to suit the occasion.
