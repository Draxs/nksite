This hotel is an oasis from the light and heat and noise of urban life. A true boutique hotel in the city centre, The <a href="https://thesaintjohnmalta.com/" target="_blank">Saint John</a> offers a lovely bar and cafe restaurant as well as being well located for the best Valletta has to offer. 

My simple but elegant dress is a mix of yin and yang, with its plain tailoring and soft primrose yellow colour. Perfect for barefoot lounging in style.

Dove grey walls, sumptuous throws, buttery soft leather tub chairs and industrial style lighting all meld to create a calm, welcoming and stylish space. Add fluffy towels, quilted headboards and soft rugs underfoot and you have a hugely comfortable room.

My capsule wardrobe, when travelling, will always include my signature high waisted trousers; these beautiful caramel trousers, with their exaggerated cuffs and elegant sheen will take you effortlessly day to night with a change of shoes and jewellery.

Pair with a strapless bustier and a light jacket for urban chic. Lose the jacket and add a statement necklace for the evening.

Downstairs at The Saint John, there is a great bar and cafe style restaurant, so you can wear your highest heels and keep smiling, however long the day has been.
