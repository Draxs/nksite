            <p>Hello and thank you for visiting my website. I can’t do my job without people like you so I want you to know how much I appreciate your time and your feedback.</p>
            <p>Part of my work is telling a story with a picture: you may notice that I love clothes and I love art and architecture. I studied at art school but finishing college doesn’t mean stopping your education. Every day I learn more though travelling, reading, talking and listening to people. People like you. I aim to make each one of my stories and photos better every time, so please let me know if I’m doing a good job!</p>  
            <p>I’ve had a varied career and moved countries twice so far in my life. Be brave and say yes is my mantra. I love fashion. But, for me fashion is more than pretty clothes or cool jewellery; it’s the individual statement of your style, your personality. It’s about feeling good about yourself.</p> 
            <p>I hope my photos and stories can be part of your way to find your individual style. I am still learning and changing, experimenting and having fun. I don’t work with companies who are not ethical, not fair to their workforce or who don’t respect the environment. I don’t wear clothes that don’t suit me or I don’t like, regardless of how many ‘inducements’ I am offered. I think integrity is one of the most important things in your life and you should not comprise.</p>
            <p>These are the things that are important to me. Let me know what is important to you.</p>     
            <p>Nena xx</p>
