I"ï	<p>Have you ever noticed how well Mediterranean women do pastels in autumn and winter? Maybe itâ€™s the light here, but the weight and weave of the fabric also make a difference. Delicate silks and cottons are perfect for summer, however, as the seasons change, itâ€™s nice to have  more of a layer between you and the wind.</p>

<p>So why wear brown or grey? If you want to hold on to that final summer feeling, choose pastels.</p>

<p>I plumped for Baby Pink, Dove Grey and Bright White for this outfit; these are not neutral colours by any means so you need to aware of how your shades  and hues work. And you need to consider your fabrics.</p>

<p>My lined jacket allows me to be brave and wear the skimpiest of skimpy as a base layer so the jacket is a major statement. Pushing back the sleeves to bracelet length doesnâ€™t just show off the pretty lining, but also gives you an opportunity to display a little jewellery or just tanned arms to suit your style. As the jacket is tailored, it also highlights your figure and gives real glamour.</p>

<p>Last, but certainly not least â€“ accessories. My beautiful <a href="https://www.cameliaroma.com/en/" target="_blank">Camelia Roma</a> bag is the perfect shade, not to mention the perfect size. The detachable strap means it works brilliantly as a clutch or a cross body depending on where you are going.</p>

<p>Finish off this serious styled look with sleek hair and a full on plum pout; the delicacy of the pastels works fabulously with dramatic but sophisticated makeup. And, of course, never be without the perfect sunnies.</p>

<p>Hello autumn but itâ€™s not quite farewell summer yet.</p>
