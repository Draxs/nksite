I"<p>This is investment dressing that won’t break the bank or tie you to one look or season
You all know how much I love summer but I am so happy to see the seasons changing. The reason? Look what I found in <a href="https://www.massimodutti.com/mt" target="_blank">Massimo Dutti</a>.</p>

<p>My black ‘suit’ is actually three separate pieces but designed to be worn together or individually depending on the occasion. Staring with this season’s must-have waistcoat, I chose to wear mine with a bralette but it also looks super cool with an oversized shirt or a skinny tee.</p>

<p>The waistcoat - like the trousers and blazer - is fully lined and made from 99% wool with 1% elastane to give it both sheen and little stretchability. The jacket will take you boardroom to bar as well as lot of other places. Tailored to hang perfectly with skirts or trousers, it fastens with one statement button.</p>

<p>The trousers have that slim fitting ‘cigarette pant’ elegance that means they look amazing with heels, loafers, boots or ballerinas. As they have a 2% elastane and 98% wool composition, you get flexibility of movement from the soft fabric without losing the shape of the tailoring.</p>

<p>For a completely different autumnal feel, my Nappa leather shirt with top stitching is perfect tucked into these gorgeous beige wool trousers. It is also great as a ‘shacket’ once the weather gets a little fresher.</p>

<p>The khaki lambskin crossbody bag is exactly right for the days when you need all your ‘stuff’ but also to keep your hands free and still look elegant.
What I really appreciate about these clothes and accessories is that they are ethically produced as well as beautifully designed and made.</p>
