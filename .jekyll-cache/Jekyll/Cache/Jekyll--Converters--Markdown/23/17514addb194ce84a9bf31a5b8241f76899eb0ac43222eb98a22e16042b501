I"«<p>How to make colder weather stylish?</p>

<p>Those of you who know me, know that I donâ€™t do cold. However, that doesnâ€™t mean that I donâ€™t know how to do cold! Bright sunny days, as the weather changes and cools, provide a perfect opportunity for some elegant snuggling with wool and cashmere. White white jeans, with a deep turn up, make the most of the light and give a great counterpoint to my monochrome, belted coat with its jet black lining.</p>

<p>Patch pockets are the best for keeping your hands warm while strolling casually through the city and the neat belt cinches your waist to keep you looking sleek. I could have chosen a black sweater to keep the monochrome look but my delicate salmon polo provides a great pop of colour without taking away from the black and white styling. The finishing touch for this outfit has to be these beautiful shoes:</p>

<p>flash a tanned ankle with these bejwelled slingback heels. The â€˜diamondsâ€™ give a gorgeous sparkle and will take you straight to The Ritz if you fancy. Keep your make up flawless,with a strong lip colour and perfect brows.</p>
