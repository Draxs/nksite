<p>I stayed at the <a href="http://www.praktikhotels.com/" target="_blank">Praktik Metropol</a> in central Madrid. I have visited many cities in Europe, but I have to tell you that Madrid is one of the most beautiful and majestic of them all. The architecture - both heritage and modernist - is wonderful, the shopping is fantastic and art and culture are everywhere.</p>

<p>My hotel, the striking and quirky <a href="http://www.praktikhotels.com/" target="_blank">Praktik Metropol</a> was located on Gran Via - THE main street in Madrid. The views from the rooms are stunning, especially from the corner suites (there are only three of these and worth booking) and so, every morning, you can look out across the city and decide where you are going to go.</p>

<p>The hotel is stylish, elegant, comfortable and beautifully designed. From the fabulous leather sofas to the refectory style, tables and open fireplaces, it was like the best of everything in one space. An easy check-in and great reception staff also added to the experience.</p>

<p>The rooms had such comfy beds and I loved all the crisp white bedlinen. It makes a bed look really fresh and inviting. Art deco style tiled floors and cool â€˜graffittiâ€™ art in the bedrooms were a beautiful counterpoint alongside the Bakelite phones and vintage luggage.</p>

<p>The hotel has many â€˜Scandinavianâ€™ touches throughout its design and one of the nicest was the great power shower. It got a little chilly in the late afternoons and so it was wonderful to come back to plenty of hot water!</p>

<p>Chilly. Hmmâ€¦ not my favourite word but a great opportunity to wear amazing leather gloves, elegant tweed and pinstripes. I even got to wear my Pringle style jumper at last.</p>

<p>I expect you are wondering about the food? Well, keeping the best till last, I officially love, love, love Spanish food. Traditional paella is always an amazing dish but this trip, I discovered churros. Served for breakfast or elevenses, you can dip them in chocolate or just enjoy them with your coffee.
Madrid was a total delight. A big city with a huge variety of everything on offer, friendly people and sunshine. I think I may have found my new home.</p>
