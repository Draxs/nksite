I"<p>Getting ready each morning can be a worry if you are short on time and long on chores and this is why the shirt dress has to be the best fashion statement of 2019. Or anytime really as it is a true style staple.</p>

<p>Dress, scarf, belt and bag and youâ€™re good to go anywhere. This beautiful outfit is all from the â€˜Chaotic Eleganceâ€™ range at <a href="https://mt.weekendmaxmara.com/new-arrival?gclsrc=aw.ds&amp;&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMI0__qpJPp5AIVEM53Ch0ECAMbEAAYASAAEgIg2fD_BwE" target="_blank">WEEKEND MAXMARA</a> and is part of their Signature Collection. Inspired by the master glass artist Ritsue Mishima, the gorgeous â€˜Bahamasâ€™ scarf in silk twill is a totally fabulous addition to any wardrobe. Its size means it works well as a wrap, a scarf or just a beautiful piece of art.</p>

<p>The dress itself also has some amazing customised detailing to the back in grosgrain, velvet and lace. <a href="https://mt.weekendmaxmara.com/new-arrival?gclsrc=aw.ds&amp;&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMI0__qpJPp5AIVEM53Ch0ECAMbEAAYASAAEgIg2fD_BwE" target="_blank">WEEKEND MAXMARA</a> are famous for their quality and attention to detail and this lovely dress is no exception.</p>

<p>Paired with my â€˜Lellaâ€™ denim dress, it bigs up the shirtdress into a more elegant outfit to take you to the office ,lunch or a day at the galleries. Made from pure cotton denim with big pockets and side splits, the â€˜Lellaâ€™ dress is bliss to wear in all weathers. I cinched mine with the elegant â€˜Jockâ€™ leather belt with its unusual detailing on the buckle. For more casual occasions you could wear this dress loose, with big boots and a shawl for a fab boho look.</p>

<p>No outfit is complete without a bag and the â€˜Ricardâ€™ from the Pasticccino range is my favourite. Quilted khaki satin and the trademark <a href="https://mt.weekendmaxmara.com/new-arrival?gclsrc=aw.ds&amp;&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMI0__qpJPp5AIVEM53Ch0ECAMbEAAYASAAEgIg2fD_BwE" target="_blank">WEEKEND MAXMARA</a> fastenings make this bag tactile but practical. Tubular handles and a beautiful silk lining give the finishing touches of luxury and elegance.</p>

<p>I love the versatility of this outfit. Whether you are strolling, shopping, lunching or working, you will look and feel amazing and thatâ€™s really what itâ€™s all about.</p>
