I"E<p>As we adapt to the challenges of living with Covid-19, I hope you are all safe and have managed to enjoy your summer? Trying to book a holiday when restrictions and rules change daily has been hard for everyone, so making sure you have a wonderful time, if you do manage to get away, is essential.</p>

<p>Safety and sunshine with style and luxury â€“ those are my new requirements, so a visit to The Kempinski Hotel in San Lawrenz, on the beautiful little island of Gozo was the perfect choice. A short journey from Malta by ferry, Gozo is a tinybut fabulous island with a gastronomic reputation and a significant place in history.</p>
