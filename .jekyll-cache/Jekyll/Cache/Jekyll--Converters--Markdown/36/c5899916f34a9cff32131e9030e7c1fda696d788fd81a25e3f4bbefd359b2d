I"|<p>September is always a gorgeous month; it feels like everything is starting again and a new season is beginning. So I am delighted to share my latest find with you! Malta Marriott Hotel and Spa, Balluta Bay, St Julian’s, is a totally delightful and delicious experience. I am still on Cloud 9 after a long weekend of luxury and style.</p>

<p>The hotel mixes old with new beautifully. Located opposite the promenade and the beach, it has fabulous views from every direction. From the classic Maltese Villa façade entrance and stone balconies to the truly sumptuous and deluxe hotel rising behind, it is total bliss the whole way.</p>

<p>A cool colour palette of grey, ecru and duck egg with pops of Mediterranean blue and the most amazing carpets is just beautiful. Whether you are on business or holiday, everywhere in the Malta Marriott feels perfect.</p>
