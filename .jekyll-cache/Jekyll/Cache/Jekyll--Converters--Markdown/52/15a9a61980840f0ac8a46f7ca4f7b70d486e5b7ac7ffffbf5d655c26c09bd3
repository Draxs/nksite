<p>Whether it’s for a selfie in your garden or an Insta worthy pose on a cool beach, we all want to look good in swimwear. So I was delighted to find the beautiful and thoughtful swimwear brand Morning Glory here in Malta.</p>

<p>I say ‘thoughtful’ because of the incredible thought that has gone into the design of these one-pieces and bikinis. The sizing is perfect and clearly the designers understand women’s bodies - and minds - as the adjustable straps mean that not only can you tan safely and evenly, but you choose just how much skin you want to show and how to show it.</p>

<p>Paired with my ‘Lella’ denim dress, it bigs up the shirtdress into a more elegant outfit to take you to the office ,lunch or a day at the galleries. Made from pure cotton denim with big pockets and side splits, the ‘Lella’ dress is bliss to wear in all weathers. I cinched mine with the elegant ‘Jock’ leather belt with its unusual detailing on the buckle. For more casual occasions you could wear this dress loose, with big boots and a shawl for a fab boho look.</p>

<p>No outfit is complete without a bag and the ‘Ricard’ from the Pasticccino range is my favourite. Quilted khaki satin and the trademark <a href="https://mt.weekendmaxmara.com/new-arrival?gclsrc=aw.ds&amp;&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMI0__qpJPp5AIVEM53Ch0ECAMbEAAYASAAEgIg2fD_BwE" target="_blank">WEEKEND MAXMARA</a> fastenings make this bag tactile but practical. Tubular handles and a beautiful silk lining give the finishing touches of luxury and elegance.</p>

<p>I love the versatility of this outfit. Whether you are strolling, shopping, lunching or working, you will look and feel amazing and that’s really what it’s all about.</p>
