I"ç	<p>Here we are in Week 10 (for us) of social distancing and self- isolating and I hope youâ€™re all well and coping with the way we now must live for the foreseeable future?</p>

<p>I quickly made a â€˜new routineâ€™ for myself, particularly once the novelty of wearing pyjamas while snacking and bingeing on boxsets all day wore off! I still love seeing photos of the food everyone is making though â€“ whether you are a professional or just a foodie, the imagination and creativity has been inspiring throughout.</p>

<p>I am also so impressed how all our restaurants have reinvented themselves, offering delivery of anything and everything you want and when you want it.</p>

<p>Fresh chickpeas, rainbow quinoa, grilled zucchini, shredded kale, pulled chicken and more â€“ my mouth is watering as I am typing â€“ are all dressed up and ready to go. Fresh wraps and bakery are available daily, as well as salads and spring specials so you never get bored with the menu.</p>
