I"<p>This is investment dressing that won’t break the bank or tie you to one look or season
You all know how much I love summer but I am so happy to see the seasons changing. The reason? Look what I found in <a href="https://www.massimodutti.com/mt" target="_blank">Massimo Dutti</a>.</p>

<p>I say ‘thoughtful’ because of the incredible thought that has gone into the design of these one-pieces and bikinis. The sizing is perfect and clearly the designers understand women’s bodies - and minds - as the adjustable straps mean that not only can you tan safely and evenly, but you choose just how much skin you want to show and how to show it.</p>

<p>The current collection ‘Fuse’ is very stylish. One- pieces are elegantly sexy and hugely flattering. Bikinis have a reversible design so you get two looks for one. Bikini bottoms comprise classic triangle, Brazilian or ‘Cheeky’ and there’s a range of matching bandeau and triangular tops. Offering XS to 2XL, every size and shape can look great in <a href="https://www.morninggloryswimwear.com/" target="_blank">Morning Glory</a>.</p>

<p>I particularly love the acknowledgement of Malta’s fabulous colours. Using a classic ‘Maltese tile’ pattern in signature blues and greens with red highlights, this design is unique in swimwear and conveys effortless and cosmopolitan style. Furthermore, block jewel colours in emerald, sapphire and coral – here called ‘Dreamy Rouge’ – on both the one-pieces and bikinis suit and flatter every skin tone.</p>

<p>There are definitely beach babe experts behind this brand. Not only will you look amazing surf or poolside but this collection was designed to get wet. Perfect for sea swimming too as the well-cut silhouettes stay where they are supposed to. The quality is exceptional with seamless finishes and really beautiful touches, such as the signature silver beading on the ties.</p>

<p>I am also glad I can still wear this gorgeous bikini even during the pregnancy.
So, if you want to look and feel like a million dollars (but for considerably less), <a href="https://www.morninggloryswimwear.com/" target="_blank">www.morninggloryswimwear.com</a> needs to be your new go-to brand.</p>
