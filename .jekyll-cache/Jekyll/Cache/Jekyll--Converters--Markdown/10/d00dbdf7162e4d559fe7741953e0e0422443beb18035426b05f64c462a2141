I"ù<p>This is investment dressing that wonâ€™t break the bank or tie you to one look or season
You all know how much I love summer but I am so happy to see the seasons changing. The reason? Look what I found in <a href="https://www.massimodutti.com/mt" target="_blank">Massimo Dutti</a>.</p>

<p>My black â€˜suitâ€™ is actually three separate pieces but designed to be worn together or individually depending on the occasion. Staring with this seasonâ€™s must-have waistcoat, I chose to wear mine with a bralette but it also looks super cool with an oversized shirt or a skinny tee.</p>

<p>The waistcoat - like the trousers and blazer - is fully lined and made from 99% wool with 1% elastane to give it both sheen and little stretchability. The jacket will take you boardroom to bar as well as lot of other places. Tailored to hang perfectly with skirts or trousers, it fastens with one statement button.</p>
