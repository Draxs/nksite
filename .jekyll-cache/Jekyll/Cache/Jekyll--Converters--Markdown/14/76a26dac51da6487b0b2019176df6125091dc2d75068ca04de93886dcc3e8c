I"y<p>Wherever you are, I hope Spring has arrived. Yup, it’s time to shed warm coats and puffas and shop the spring jacket. While black and navy are classics and a very useful staple in everyone’s wardrobe, nothing says Spring 2019 like this beautiful, deep blue check jacket.</p>

<p>With its gorgeous wide lapels and sophisticated button detailing, it really is a statement piece. Slightly oversized to give you a waif like silhouette, this jacket will work across every type of weather we get - either with a skinny jersey or fine knit tee underneath.</p>

<p>The two-tone check design means you can match or contrast your bottom half: I chose my favourite high waisted style, cropped palazzo pants in deep red to pick up on the pattern and contrasted the look overall with a glossy white vest.</p>

<p>Glam up with killer heels and strong make-up or make it a more relaxed look over cropped, frayed hem jeans with flatties. Whatever you choose, I guarantee you will look amazing! Thank you <a href="https://www.verveboutique.com/" target="_blank">Verve</a></p>
