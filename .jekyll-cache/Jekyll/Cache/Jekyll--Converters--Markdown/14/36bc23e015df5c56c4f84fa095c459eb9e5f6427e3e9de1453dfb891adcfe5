I"	<p>Whether it’s for a selfie in your garden or an Insta worthy pose on a cool beach, we all want to look good in swimwear. So I was delighted to find the beautiful and thoughtful swimwear brand Morning Glory here in Malta.</p>

<p>I say ‘thoughtful’ because of the incredible thought that has gone into the design of these one-pieces and bikinis. The sizing is perfect and clearly the designers understand women’s bodies - and minds - as the adjustable straps mean that not only can you tan safely and evenly, but you choose just how much skin you want to show and how to show it.</p>
