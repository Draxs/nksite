I"G<p>Wow â€“ look at me! Now that is not something I would usually say, as I like my clothes to do the talking discreetly. However, this umbrella is truly the most impressive and beautiful â€˜accessoryâ€™ it is possible for a woman (or a man of course) to have. You cannot not look at it! I actually want it to rain so I can open it.</p>

<p>Handmade in Italy by <a href="https://www.pasottiombrelli.com/" target="_blank">Pasotti Ombrelli</a>, their umbrellas are out of this world with their styling, design and quality. I especially love the two-colour tones and that the inside carries a different pattern. Thereâ€™s a design for everyone who appreciates quirky elegance and perfect attention to detail. The long handle also makes these umbrellas very stylish when rolled up as well as when open.</p>

<p>Wherever you live in the world, donâ€™t let the rain be anything other than a blessing. A Pasotti umbrella keeps the stylish woman cool, calm and dry. You can get a smaller/handbag size one too from Pasotti, but I love the glamour and theatricality of the larger version.</p>

<p>For this shoot, I chose a lightweight, military style wool coat in creamy white. Winter in the Med is not really â€˜winterâ€™ as I know it, so you can get away with lighter fabrics. I put a dark plum jersey under to co-ordinate with the umbrella and to contrast with the winter white wool. My silver, accordion pleated skirt is button-through to give plenty of swing and flare. Cinched at the waist to flatter the figure, choose a deep belt to really give definition to your curves. My shoes are fabulous: royal blue fabric with deep plum flowers to give that colour â€˜popâ€™ that just makes your look your own.</p>

<p>My look is super stylish in homage to my beautiful umbrella, so my make-up and hair are very sleek and chic. Attention to detail and grooming are the keys to pulling off this look. Add the perfect umbrella and youâ€™re ready for anything.</p>
