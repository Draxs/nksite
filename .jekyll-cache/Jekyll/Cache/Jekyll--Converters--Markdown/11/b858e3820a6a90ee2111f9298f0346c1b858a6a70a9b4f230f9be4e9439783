I"¿<p>There are some places that are unforgettable; places that make the kind of impact in your memory so that just a smell or sound can instantly transport you back there. Casa Ellul, one of the original boutique hotels in Valletta, is such a place. I had the pleasure of staying there recently and I am still enchanted.</p>

<p>The hotel is located in a beautiful, busy old street which looks straight down to the sea. Opposite both the stunning Teatru Manoel and St Paulâ€™s Co-Cathedral, Casa Ellul is an original 19th century Maltese townhouse that has been in the same family since 1830.</p>

<p>Maybe itâ€™s this heritage and long-term connection to history that makes it such a special place. It offers only nine suites in total so the sense is more of being in a private home â€“ but what a home!</p>
