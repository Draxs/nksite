I"V<p>Whether it’s for a selfie in your garden or an Insta worthy pose on a cool beach, we all want to look good in swimwear. So I was delighted to find the beautiful and thoughtful swimwear brand Morning Glory here in Malta.</p>

<p>I say ‘thoughtful’ because of the incredible thought that has gone into the design of these one-pieces and bikinis.</p>

<div class="row no-gutters">
    <div class="col-md-6 col-sm-12">
        <div class="post-left-image" style="background: url(../images/fashion/morning-glory-swimwear/morning-glory-11.jpg) no-repeat; background-size: cover; margin-right: 0.5rem; max-height: 630px !important"></div>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-6 col-sm-12">
        <div class="post-right-image" style="background: url(../images/fashion/morning-glory-swimwear/morning-glory-23.jpg) no-repeat; background-size: cover; margin-left: 0.5rem; max-height: 630px !important"></div>
    </div>

<p>The sizing is perfect and clearly the designers understand women’s bodies - and minds - as the adjustable straps mean that not only can you tan safely and evenly, but you choose just how much skin you want to show and how to show it.</p>

<p>The current collection ‘Fuse’ is very stylish. One- pieces are elegantly sexy and hugely flattering. Bikinis have a reversible design so you get two looks for one.</p>

        <div class="post-left-image" style="background: url(../images/fashion/morning-glory-swimwear/morning-glory-16.jpg) no-repeat; background-size: cover; margin-right: 0.5rem; max-height: 630px !important"></div>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-6 col-sm-12">
        <div class="post-right-image" style="background: url(../images/fashion/morning-glory-swimwear/morning-glory-15.jpg) no-repeat; background-size: cover; margin-left: 0.5rem; max-height: 630px !important"></div>
    </div>

<p>Bikini bottoms comprise classic triangle, Brazilian or ‘Cheeky’ and there’s a range of matching bandeau and triangular tops. Offering XS to 2XL, every size and shape can look great in Morning Glory.</p>

<p>I particularly love the acknowledgement of Malta’s fabulous colours. Using a classic ‘Maltese tile’ pattern in signature blues and greens with red highlights, this design is unique in swimwear and conveys effortless and cosmopolitan style.</p>

    <div class="col-md-6 col-sm-12">
        <div class="post-left-image" style="background: url(../images/fashion/morning-glory-swimwear/morning-glory-4.jpg) no-repeat; background-size: cover; margin-right: 0.5rem; max-height: 630px !important"></div>

    <div class="col-md-6 col-sm-12">

<p>Furthermore, block jewel colours in emerald, sapphire and coral – here called ‘Dreamy Rouge’ – on both the one-pieces and bikinis suit and flatter every skin tone.</p>

<p>There are definitely beach babe experts behind this brand. Not only will you look amazing surf or poolside but this collection was designed to get wet.</p>
