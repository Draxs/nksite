I"ž<p>â€˜Refined , romantic, always feminineâ€™ â€“ this is my signature style for eveningwear and a great mind set to have when choosing a Little Black Dress. Able to be dressed up or down depending on the occasion, the  LBD is the stylish womanâ€™s wardrobe staple and finding the perfect one is every womanâ€™s style goal.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.mishacollection.eu/shop.html?utm_source=instagrambio&amp;utm_medium=instagram&amp;utm_campaign=shopall" target="_blank">Misha Collection</a>, an Australian brand founded by Michelle Aznavorian, a talented designer and entrepreneur, is my go-to site for LBDs. They ship (free of charge) to Europe as well as being represented in many cities worldwide. Think of the most beautiful store in the coolest shopping street and that is where you will find Misha Collection.</p>

<p>My choice, from the many gorgeous dresses available, is this beautiful and sexy halter neck dress with a dipped back and deep V front. Perfect for showing off your tan! The waterfall layering of the fabric at the front works on both large busted girls as well as the less well endowed and pulls your waist in to create an amazing â€˜ hourglassâ€™ silhouette.</p>

<p>This is a killer dress for any occasion with its side slit but it is also incredibly well made: fully lined and with secure button detailing at the neck and an invisible zip to prevent â€˜wardrobe malfunctionsâ€™.</p>

<p>Finish with simple but classy accessories: my retro, cat eye tortoiseshell sunnies are perfect with this dress to exude glamour and mystique.</p>
