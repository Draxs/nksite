I"‘<p>This is investment dressing that wonâ€™t break the bank or tie you to one look or season
You all know how much I love summer but I am so happy to see the seasons changing. The reason? Look what I found in <a href="https://www.massimodutti.com/mt" target="_blank">Massimo Dutti</a>.</p>

<p>My black â€˜suitâ€™ is actually three separate pieces but designed to be worn together or individually depending on the occasion. Staring with this seasonâ€™s must-have waistcoat, I chose to wear mine with a bralette but it also looks super cool with an oversized shirt or a skinny tee.</p>

<p>The waistcoat - like the trousers and blazer - is fully lined and made from 99% wool with 1% elastane to give it both sheen and little stretchability. The jacket will take you boardroom to bar as well as lot of other places. Tailored to hang perfectly with skirts or trousers, it fastens with one statement button.</p>

<p>The trousers have that slim fitting â€˜cigarette pantâ€™ elegance that means they look amazing with heels, loafers, boots or ballerinas. As they have a 2% elastane and 98% wool composition, you get flexibility of movement from the soft fabric without losing the shape of the tailoring.</p>

<p>For a completely different autumnal feel, my Nappa leather shirt with top stitching is perfect tucked into these gorgeous beige wool trousers. It is also great as a â€˜shacketâ€™ once the weather gets a little fresher.</p>

<p>The khaki lambskin crossbody bag is exactly right for the days when you need all your â€˜stuffâ€™ but also to keep your hands free and still look elegant.
What I really appreciate about these clothes and accessories is that they are ethically produced as well as beautifully designed and made.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.massimodutti.com/mt" target="_blank">Massimo Dutti</a> use Leather Working Group Gold and Silver standard tanneries so the production of the shirt â€“ and all their leather goods â€“ has minimal impact on the environment. The same mindset applies to the trousers as they are made with a minimum of 20% recycled wool. So you can look amazing and still feel good about buying.</p>

<p>I love shopping and the Massimo Dutti shops are all beautifully and thoughtfully designed so that going there is a real experience. However, I really rate their online service too. Sometimes a girl just canâ€™t get out of the house or office, so having an easy-to-navigate website and guest checkout for speedy purchases certainly makes life easier. All you need then is a little patience for the delivery to arrive!</p>
