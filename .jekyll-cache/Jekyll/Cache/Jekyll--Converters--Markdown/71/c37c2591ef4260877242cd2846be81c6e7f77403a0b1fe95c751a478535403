I";<p>The temperature’s rising and summer is definitely here, but you can still look cool and chic in a white trouser suit and black top combo. Whether it’s for work or pleasure, fresh white tailoring will take you day to night in effortless style.</p>

<p>Black and white is one of my favourite colour sets: smart, sexy and sophisticated, it is understated class as its best.</p>

<p>Choose an edge to edge jacket for an elegant silhouette and pair with pleat waisted, tailored trousers. The contrast of the black top with its intricate detailing and daring neckline makes this outfit perfect for a city lunch, dinner, drinks on the terrace or a glamorous soirée. Depending on the shoes you choose - skyscraper heels or plimsolls all work - the white trouser suit can be your most flexible outfit for summer.</p>

<p>The final touch – perfect sunnies to create that film star look.</p>
