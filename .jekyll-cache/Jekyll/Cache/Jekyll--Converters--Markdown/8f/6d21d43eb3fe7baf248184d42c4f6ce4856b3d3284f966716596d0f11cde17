<p>My capsule wardrobe, when travelling, will always include my signature high waisted trousers; these beautiful caramel trousers, with their exaggerated cuffs and elegant sheen will take you effortlessly day to night with a change of shoes and jewellery.</p>

<p>Pair with a strapless bustier and a light jacket for urban chic. Lose the jacket and add a statement necklace for the evening.</p>
