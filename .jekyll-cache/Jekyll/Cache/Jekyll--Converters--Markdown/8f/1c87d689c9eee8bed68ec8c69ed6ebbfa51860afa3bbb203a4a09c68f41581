I"P<p>Classic with a Twist is my mantra and one of the reasons I am so in love with the new A19<a href="https://mt.weekendmaxmara.com/new-arrival?gclsrc=aw.ds&amp;&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMI0__qpJPp5AIVEM53Ch0ECAMbEAAYASAAEgIg2fD_BwE" target="_blank">WEEKEND MAXMARA</a> collection. Blazers are the hot ticket item this season and who couldn’t be delighted with this beautiful double breasted iteration?</p>

<p>Made from pure cotton 500 rib corduroy in the most autumnal shade of golden brown, it is slightly fitted to give you a great shape. The step lapels and flap pockets keep to classic tailored lines; however it is still relaxed enough to wear with jeans or leather leggings when you want to look effortlessly amazing.</p>

<p>I chose a very original Jacquard jersey pencil skirt to give me a long, lean silhouette. Pairing this with <a href="https://mt.weekendmaxmara.com/new-arrival?gclsrc=aw.ds&amp;&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMI0__qpJPp5AIVEM53Ch0ECAMbEAAYASAAEgIg2fD_BwE" target="_blank">WEEKEND MAXMARA</a> sneakers in suede and leather colour blocking instantly says ‘relaxed and ready for fun’ whether you are working, holidaying or just someone who likes to be comfortable but still look very pulled together.</p>

<p>In colder weather, I would choose either ankle or long boots to take me through winter but, for now, I am happy to show off the last of my summer tan.</p>

<p>Cream knitwear is another staple from <a href="https://mt.weekendmaxmara.com/new-arrival?gclsrc=aw.ds&amp;&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMI0__qpJPp5AIVEM53Ch0ECAMbEAAYASAAEgIg2fD_BwE" target="_blank">WEEKEND MAXMARA</a>. Their fabulous quality, use of natural materials – such as alpaca, silk and cashmere –and attention to detail,make every item truly beautiful in its own right.</p>

<p>Even better, these clothes are meant to last. Whilst my ‘outfit’ is certainly fashionable, each individual item will not date and will be as gorgeous in ten years’ time as it is today. Not many brands can boast this.</p>

<div class="row no-gutters">
    <div class="col-md-6 col-sm-12">
        <div class="post-left-image" style="background: url(../images/fashion/maxmara2/maxmara-12.jpg) no-repeat; background-size: cover; margin-right: 0.5rem; max-height: 630px !important"></div>

<p>The deal maker for me however has got to be my Pasticcino bag from <a href="https://mt.weekendmaxmara.com/new-arrival?gclsrc=aw.ds&amp;&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMI0__qpJPp5AIVEM53Ch0ECAMbEAAYASAAEgIg2fD_BwE" target="_blank">WEEKEND MAXMARA</a>. This supersized but deconstructed clutch, made from cable stitched knit, can also be crossbody or a handbag thanks to its double detachable straps in leather and chain.</p>

<p><img src="/images/fashion/maxmara2/maxmara-18.jpg" alt="maxmara-18.jpg" /></p>

<p>With its customised spheres for opening and closing the bag, it is a real statement piece whilst simultaneously being rather discreet. Now that is classic with a twist.</p>

<p>To keep my look long and lean, I went with a very sleek topknot hairdo and flawless makeup. Jewellery is absolutely minimal; just add oversized sunglasses. These clothes speak for themselves so you can relax and enjoy the compliments coming your way.</p>
