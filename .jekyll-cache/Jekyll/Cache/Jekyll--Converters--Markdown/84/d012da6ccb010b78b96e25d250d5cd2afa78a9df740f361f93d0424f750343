I"9	<p>A trip on a luxury charter yacht with <a href="https://www.azureultra.com/en/" target="_blank">Azure Ultra</a> definitely called for something special to come out of the wardrobe. Glamorous, sophisticated but casual and practical – thoughts of the sun, the wind, how to climb elegantly out of the tender to board the yacht were at the forefront of my mind – are the key elements to successful on-board dressing. So, let’s just all give thanks for the jumpsuit: ticking every box of practical but elegant and sophisticated, this burnt umber silk crepe de chine jumpsuit is possibly the best item of clothing I have ever worn.</p>

<p>Perfect for lounging or posing on the foredeck, the billowing style with its cinched waist gives that effortless look of summer style, whilst its strong rich colour will take you from early summer/pre tan right through to when the nights start to draw in.</p>

<p>In homage to the teak decks, we were barefoot on board, but this jumpsuit works beautifully with both heels or glamourous Boho sandals. Add a wide brim hat and cat’s eye sunnies and head for the islands.</p>
